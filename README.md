# About
* An application for downloading Level II data from the NEXRAD Level II archive
* Takes user input for the month, day, year, radar site code (KHTX - Huntsville AL for example), along with beginning and ending time frames in Zulu
* (Format for times goes as follows: HHMMSS) with all times needing to be in Zulu

# Installation

1. Download Github repo
2. Run `.exe` file
3. If smartscreen comes up, click more info -> run anyway // this warning is entirely harmless and only shows because the app is not signed

# Issues
* Be sure to open an issue and I will be more than happy to fix it!

# Roadmap
1. Give user the option to download all of the current days RADNEX archive without needing to prompt for time frame
2. More to come...
